## üîß Technical Details

### Core Technologies
- **React 19.1.1**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **MediaPipe**: Google's pose detection library
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Canvas API**: Real-time pose visualization

### Key Components

#### `PoseDetector.jsx`
- Handles camera initialization and pose detection
- Manages exercise state and rep counting
- Provides real-time feedback and UI updates

#### `exerciseRules.js`
- Contains validation logic for all exercises
- Defines angle thresholds and feedback messages
- Modular design for easy exercise addition

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smooth Landmarks**: Enabled for stable tracking
- **Model Complexity**: Balanced for speed and accuracy
- **Canvas Optimization**: Efficient drawing with proper cleanup
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## üéØ Exercise Validation Logic

### Angle Calculations
The application calculates joint angles using three-point geometry:
```javascript
const calculateAngle = (point1, point2, point3) => {
  const radians = Math.atan2(point3.y - point2.y, point3.x - point2.x) -
                 Math.atan2(point1.y - point2.y, point1.x - point2.x);
  let angle = Math.abs(radians * 180.0 / Math.PI);
  if (angle > 180.0) angle = 360 - angle;
  return angle;
};
```

### Enhanced Rep Detection
Each exercise uses sophisticated motion phase detection for accurate rep counting:

#### üèãÔ∏è Bicep Curls
- **Phase Detection**: Extended (160¬∞) ‚Üí Contracted (70¬∞) ‚Üí Extended (160¬∞)
